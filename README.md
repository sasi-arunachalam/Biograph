Hi All,

I am working  in Genomics and Precision Medicine Research. My expertise and current work is on NGS RNAseq analysis, Whole exome sequencing analysis for prediction of disease pathway, identifying signature genes and pathogenic mutagens. 

I have a PhD in Biomedical science and worked as an antibody research and production scientist for four years at Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

My interest is to apply Machine learning (Deep learning) algorithm in genomic and precision medicine specially in feature selection among large genomic cancer data sets, cancer disease prognosis and treatment prediction/identifying personalized treatment options
